# HYPOTHYROIDISM-PREDICTION

## Overview 

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:  

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## Project Deliverables

Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

Read and explore the given dataset.

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Perform univariate, bivariate analysis recording your observations.

Performing Decision tree and SVM

Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements in model improvement.

## Models Performed
